                        Hey! I’m Willyam and I’m a Front-End Developer
                        who is passionate about developing user interfaces
                        that are both compelling and accessible while also
                        maintaining the best practices when it comes to
                        writing code.

                        <br />
                        <br />

                        I pride myself on my willingness to learn as it
                        always helps me solve challenging problems.
                        Throughout <span className="highlights"> <a href="#myWork">my work</a></span>, I have had to exercise this
                        strength countless times in order to produce results.
                        Although I can work autonomously, I am more than
                        enthusiastic about collaborating with and impacting
                        teams so as to help them achieve better results.

                        <br />
                        <br />

                        Moreover, I am constantly looking for new ways to
                        expand my knowledge of all things web development and
                        am always fascinated by the ways in which technology
                        continues to improve. Feel free to <span className="highlights"><a href="#contact">contact me</a> </span> if you
                        have an opportunity that aligns with my expertise.
                    </p>
